Recent grad, looking for work!

B.S. Computer Science, CSU Sacramento Class of Spring 2022

Presales Ninja is my most in-depth project to date. I was responsible for the design of the app as well as development of the front end. Start there for the clearest idea of my level of experience. Thanks for looking!
